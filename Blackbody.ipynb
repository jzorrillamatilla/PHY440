    "- An object in thermal equilibrium has a single temperature, and does not change with time\n",
    "- If an object radiates electromagnetic radiation, it loses energy, and its temperature shoud decrease, is that a contradiction?\n",
    "    - No, it is an idealized situation. As long as the energy emitted is very small, negligible, compared to the total thermal energy contained in a body we can approximate it by a black-body\n",
    "    - Interestingly this is the situation for stars, like the sun. Even though they emit a large amount of energy (in the case of the sun, enough to warm a planet 150 million kilometers away, sustaining its biosphere and economy), that amount of energy is small to its inner energy (which is fueled by nuclear reactions), its temperature is very stable, and the black-body is a good approximation\n",

    "The mechanism by which this radiation is generated is the acceleration of its constituent electric charges (electrons) when they change course by the influence of all other charges, as they move with a velocity that depends on the body's temperature.\n",
